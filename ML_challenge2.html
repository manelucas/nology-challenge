      <h2>About</h2>
      <p> &nbsp<strong>Hello World!</strong> Hello other planets too. Welcome to my website.<br> Once upon a time I was born in Portugal. I don't quite remember this moment but my parents told me that, for I believe in them. I have a degree in Sciences of Nutrition which were followed by a fair number of years of working in Nutrition and Social care mostly in Bristol, UK up until the year 2020. <br>Since I started being curious about programming in 2019, I began to learn python and javascript during my spare time. But I wanted to learn more. Through coding I want to be able to put creative ideas into place. I also aim to create more efficient softwares for companies, and also within the healthcare service providers which I am most familiar with.</p>

        <h4>Interests</h4>   
        <p>I love to play football and squash! I am quite passionate about music and I like to play the guitar.
        Travelling is never enough. And the same applies to coffee or a nice gin and tonic with a drop of Port wine, then a couple of aniseeds. Trust me, it is better than the James Bond Martini. But in this case is stirred, not shaken.<br>
        I am also very interested in cinema and have a soft spot for cats and dogs!<br></p>
